# Musings on software architecture by solving programming puzzles

Advent of Code (AoC) is a series of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. It is a yearly event that takes place in December, since 2015 - which means that this year we had a 10-year aniversary of the event.
Each day we are treated to a new story that hides a puzzle that we need to solve. The stories all revolve around Santa, as we are always Santa's little helper, so we either help Santa with some issue, or we have to twart some evil plan by Santa's nemesis, the Easter Bunny.

Yes, that's just as corny as it sounds, but it's also a lot of fun. The puzzles do not require coding explicitly, as we only need to provide a (usually numeric) solution to the problem, but in reality, yeah, we need to code a solution to the problem. Of course, the tech stack is up to us, so we can use any language we want.

There is a subreddit with solutions and explanations, and a lot of people live stream their solutions (myself included). And since the only requirement for the code is to provide the correct answer, there is unlimited freedom in how we want to approach the puzzles.

My personal approach is to solve the tasks using an approach that is as close to a real-world scenario as possible. This means that I try to write clean, maintainable code that is easily ingestible. The code should be performant, but not at the cost of readability. The code should be easy to understand, but not at the cost of performance. And the code should be easy to extend, but not at the cost of readability or performance.

Let's see how this approach works out in practice, taking on the first puzzle of the 2024 AoC event.
