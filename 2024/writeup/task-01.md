# Advent of Code 2024, first puzzle - Historian Hysteria

So, in the first puzzle of 2024's AoC (available at [https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)), we are given two lists of numbers, and we need to do some processing on it. (What's characteristic for AoC is that we always get a sample input, and a real input. The sample input is usually small, and the real input is usually large.)

One issue that I see again and again in inexperienced developers is that they often ignore the structure of the input.
